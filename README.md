# Self_driving_car Game
Using a neural network to control a car. 
The input to the neural network is a set of distances from the borders of the track along different directions. The outputs are steer angle and speed up or down.
The neural network is optimized using Genetic algorithm. This is done using the python NEAT library.
The plan is to use different kinds of inputs and outputs such as camera field of view for the input and angular velocity as the output of the neural network and finally check which model works the best.
